### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs definitely helped me build the skills I felt I needed for this project. My biggest struggle was with the APIs and the syntax...while lab 3 provided me some practice with this, I still struggled with this. 

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added a pop up feature with more information about the movies displayed on Flixster. I also would have added some more accessibility features in order to make the website more user friendly.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, the project demo went well. In presenting and seeing my peers present, I was able to ask about different features they implemented and take notes on different methods of completing this project, which allowed me to learn more.

### Open-source libraries used

- W3Schools
- Stack Overflow

### Shout out
